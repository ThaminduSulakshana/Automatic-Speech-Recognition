# Automatic-Speech-Recognition

This repository contains the implementation of an end-to-end Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system for both Mandarin and English languages using TensorFlow. The system incorporates various deep learning techniques such as dynamic RNN (GRU, LSTM), Residual Network (Deep CNN), and Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) Decoding.

## Performance

The performance of the ASR system has been evaluated using the TIMIT database. A Phoneme Error Rate (PER) based dynamic Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BLSTM) model has been trained with casual tuning due to time constraints. 

### Prediction Example:

"The English it is evident had they not being previously showed of receiving the king would never have parted with so considerable a some an quile they weakene themselves by the same measure haf streigth and de people with whom they must afterwards have so material and interest to discuss"

## Core Features

- Dynamic RNN (GRU, LSTM)
- Residual Network (Deep CNN)
- CTC Decoding
- TIMIT Phoneme Edit Distance (PER)

## Future Work

- Release pretrained English ASR model
- Add Attention Mechanism
- Add Speaker Verification
- Add Text-to-Speech (TTS) capabilities
